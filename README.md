I built this project as part of my application to the Shopify Winter 2021 developer internship. It can be tested live [here](https://shoppiesnominations.netlify.app/).

Users can search the OMDB database for movies to nominate. OMDB responds with up to 10 movies at a time, so I implemented pagination in case the user needs to view more movies matching the same search term. Users can add and remove nominations as they like. Once they have 5 nominations, a banner prompts them to confirm their submission, which links them to a page with a sharable URL that records their nominations.
